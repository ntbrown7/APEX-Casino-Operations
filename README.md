## JavaScript Code

The JavaScript snippet below is utilized to enhance the chart's interactivity by appending a ranking to player IDs.

```javascript
// Ensure this runs after the chart is fully rendered
apex.jQuery(function($) {
  // Target the chart container by its Static ID
  var chartContainerId = 'R45844629039383693872_jet';

  // Find all text elements within the chart container
  var textElements = $('#' + chartContainerId + ' text');

  // Loop through each text element starting from index 10 and prepend the ranking
  textElements.each(function(index) {
    if (index >= 10) { // Assuming index 10 and onwards are the Player IDs
      var currentText = $(this).text();
      var newText = '#' + (index - 9) + ' ' + currentText; // index - 9 to start counting from 1
      $(this).text(newText);
    }
  });
});
```


#### Diagnostic Script
For debugging purposes, this script can be run to extract information from the chart's text elements, providing valuable insights for developers.

```javascript
// Diagnostic script to log information about the chart's text elements
var chartContainer = document.querySelector('#ENTERCONTAINERIDHERE');
if (chartContainer) {
  console.log('Chart container found:', chartContainer);

  var textElements = chartContainer.querySelectorAll('text');
  console.log('Number of text elements in the chart:', textElements.length);

  textElements.forEach(function(text, index) {
    console.log(`Text element ${index}:`, text.textContent, ' - ID:', text.id);
  });
} else {
  console.log('Chart container not found.');
}
```
